A sequence of binary digits represent powers of 2 that are added together to give a decimal value.

A sequence of binary digits represent powers of 2 that are added together to give a decimal value.
For example: 1 0 1 1 0 1 represents 1 * 25 + 0 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 22 + 0 * 21 + 1 * 20

This computes out to 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 (20 = 1) or 45 decimal.

Write a program that will input a series of binary digits typed by the user and then call a function to convert  
the string to their decimal equivalent. For convenience limit the binary number to 16 bits. Write the decimal 
equivalent to the screen. You must have a function that accepts an input string and outputs the decimal equivalent to
get credit for this program. (NOTE: It is not necessary to enter leading zeros to the left. That is you can enter 111 
for the first test case instead of all the zeros to the left.)
